## User Testing Feedback

- Readme doesn't explain site:
  - [x] Make readme better

- Colour scheme causes clashes:
  - [x] Make a more focused colour scheme

- Home page overflow:
 - [x] Redesign home page, ensure it all fits on one page

- General Design:
 - [x] Make it look more like an app

- No form validation:
 - [x] Make sure we validate the form inputs

- Number of applicants so far
 - [x] We shouldn't limit the number of applicants, so maybe the applicants don't need to know how many other people have applied - have a "no volunteers yet" label

- Language
 - [x] Design might change depending on the language due to direction of text, design to account for both

- Why group roles by organisation?
 - If we do this, we can't sort the list in a sensible way
 - [x] Instead, have the org name as part of the role listing, and then order by date, or org name or what we want to.

- Not much info on listing page, have to click through:
  - [x] Add more information to each listing (Role 1, Org Name, Location, Start Date, End Date)

- No info on role you are applying for when filling out form:
 - [x] Add info on role to form page

- Home page info:
 - [x] Not hugely informative, make it more.
